###Under construction, Awaiting more content to implement into this project 
##This was a very rewarding side task I did for a friend of mine that is into metal-work. We wanted something simplistic to showcase the steel designs and draw focus to the work more than the page. Because of this, I stuck with neutral colors and a straightforward font. 

##I built this dynamic website using Node.js, express, ejs, bootstrap, jQuery, and Gulp.
